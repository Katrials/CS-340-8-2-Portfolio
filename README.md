Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves modular design, clear variable naming, and adhering to coding conventions. 
Integrating a CRUD Python module, as done in Project Two, implements code reuse, reduces redundancy, and enhances maintainability by isolating database operations.

Approaching problems as a computer scientist requires problem-solving skills, the ability to analyze your work, and finding solutions to problems. 
This project differed from previous assignments from other courses because we used integrated databases which is very new to me (MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook) and it required me to constantly find solutions to errors I was receiving.

Computer scientists develop solutions and advance technology across various domains. Our work encourages companies like Grazioso Salvare to make data-driven decisions, and enhance customer experiences. 
By utilizing data visualization and database management techniques, we enable organizations to efficiently manage operations, track relevant metrics, and allocate resources effectively.
